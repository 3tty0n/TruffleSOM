TruffleSOM - The Simple Object Machine Smalltalk implemented using the Truffle Framework
=========================================================================================

Introduction
------------

This is the repository for TruffleSOM, an implementation of the Simple Object
Machine (SOM). SOM is a minimal Smalltalk dialect that was used to teach VM
construction at the [Hasso Plattner Institute][SOM]. It was originally built at
the University of Ã…rhus (Denmark) where it was used for teaching and as the
foundation for [Resilient Smalltalk][RS].

In addition to TruffleSOM, other implementations exist for Java (SOM), C (CSOM),
C++ (SOM++), and Squeak/Pharo Smalltalk (AweSOM).

A simple Hello World looks like:

```Smalltalk
Hello = (
  run = (
    'Hello World!' println.
  )
)
```

TruffleSOM is a [Truffle][T]-based implementation of SOM, including SOM's
standard library and a number of examples. Please see the [main project
page][SOM] for links to other VM implementations.

Obtaining and Running TruffleSOM
--------------------------------

To checkout the code, run:

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/graalvm/mx.git
    git clone https://github.com/SOM-st/TruffleSOM.git
    export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/mx

TruffleSOM uses the [mx](https://github.com/graalvm/mx) build tool, which is
easiest to use when on the PATH.

After downloading the git repositories, TruffleSOM can be build with:

    cd TruffleSOM
    ./som --setup labsjdk  # downloads a compatible JDK
    mx build

And now we, can execute tests with:

    ./som -G -cp Smalltalk TestSuite/TestHarness.som
   
A simple Hello World program is executed with:

    ./som -G -cp Smalltalk Examples/Hello.som

To work on TruffleSOM, mx can generate project definitions for
Eclipse, IntelliJ, and NetBeans. Chose the one you prefer:

    mx eclipseinit
    mx intellijinit
    mx netbeansinit

TruffleSOM uses the Graal compiler to reach state-of-the-art performance.
To use it, we need to compile it together with TruffleSOM:

    mx --env libgraal build

Afterwards, we can run a benchmark, and observe that the initial iterations
take much longer, but after a while we reach magnitudes faster execution speeds:

    ./som -cp Smalltalk Examples/Benchmarks/BenchmarkHarness.som Mandelbrot 100 500
