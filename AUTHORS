This file lists all people who have contributed to the SOM VM.

SOM was originally implemented at the University of Aarhus (Denmark) in
2001/2002. The implementation of SOM was done by Jakob Roland Andersen, Kasper
Verdich Lund, Lars Bak, Mads Torgersen, and Ulrik Pagh Schultz. They also
wrote the original versions of the SOM Smalltalk libraries, test suites, and
benchmarks, that are (in extended versions) bundled with SOM.

SOM was used by Michael Haupt in courses on virtual machines at Lancaster
University and Technische Universitaet Darmstadt (Germany) in VM courses in
2006. During that time, some changes were applied to SOM by Michael Haupt and
Sebastian Kanthak.

TruffleSOM is based on SOM as well as Oracle's Truffle Framework, which is part
of the OpenJDK Graal project.

TruffleSOM was implemented by Stefan Marr.
